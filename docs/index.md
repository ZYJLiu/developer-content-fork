Solana is a blockchain built for mass adoption. It's a high performance network
that is utilized for a range of use cases, including finance, NFTs, payments,
and gaming. Solana operates as a single global state machine, and is open,
interoperable and decentralized.

## Getting started

Dive right into Solana to start building or setup your tooling.

- [Setup local environment](/content/guides/getstarted/setup-local-development.md) -
  Install the Solana CLI to get your local development environment setup
- [Hello World in your browser](/content/guides/getstarted/hello-world-in-your-browser.md) -
  Build and deploy your first on-chain Solana program, directly in your browser
  using Solana Playground

## Start learning

Build a strong understanding of the core concepts that make Solana different
from other blockchains.

- [Transactions](/docs/core/transactions.md) - Collection of instructions for
  the blockchain to execute
- [Accounts](/docs/core/accounts.md) - Data and state storage mechanism for
  Solana
- [Programs](/docs/core/programs.md) - The executable code used to perform
  actions on the blockchain
- [Cross-Program Invocation](/docs/core/cpi.md) - Core of the "composability" of
  Solana, this is how programs can "call" each other.

## Understanding the architecture

Get to know the underlying architecture of how the proof-of-stake blockchain
works.

- [Validators](https://docs.solanalabs.com/validator/anatomy) - the individual
  nodes that are the backbone of the network
- [Clusters](/docs/core/clusters.md) - a collection of validators that work
  together for consensus

## Running a validator

Explore what it takes to operate a Solana validator and help secure the network.

- [System requirements](https://docs.solanalabs.com/operations/requirements) -
  Recommended hardware requirements and expected SOL needed to operate a
  validator
- [Quick start guide](https://docs.solanalabs.com/operations/setup-a-validator) -
  Setup a validator and get connected to a cluster for the first time

Solana is a blockchain built for mass adoption. It's a high performance network
that is utilized for a range of use cases, including finance, payments, and
gaming. Solana operates as a single global state machine, and is open,
interoperable, and decentralized.

## Why Solana?

Designed to scale, Solana is purpose built for blockchain applications to reach
millions of users. Instead of worrying about optimizing for the blockchain
layer, developers can focus on building their application to reach product
market fit. Not only can it scale now for blockchain application needs, but the
network continues to be optimized with user experience in mind.

Building the best user experience in an application is a top priority for
developers. With blockchains, the user experience is often limited by the
underlying technology, causing slow response times and high fees. Solana's low
fees and 400ms confirmation times enable developers to build applications that
are user friendly and accessible to everyone.

## Solana Features

| Feature                     | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| --------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Onchain Program Development | The ability to develop and deploy programs onchain. Users can interact with these programs permissionlessly, removing the need for middleman servers to build applications.                                                   |
| 400ms Slot Times            | Every transaction sent by users on Solana is confirmed in a block. With a target slot time of 400ms for each block, interactions by users do not have to wait, providing the best in class user experience of any blockchain. |
| Low Fees                    | Fees on Solana are well known to be low. With a median fee of 0.00064 SOL per transaction, Solana enables building for users across the world regardless of background.                                                       |
| High Throughput             | Scaling to thousands of transactions per second, Solana is built to scale with your application's user needs.                                                                                                                 |

## How to Use These Docs

On the left you will find the docs sidebar. This lists the documentation in
order from basic to more advanced information. If you are new to Solana, we
recommend starting from the top and working your way down. However, you're
welcome to read them in any order that you like.

Once you're ready to start building, checkout the
[Getting Started section](https://solana.com/docs/intro/dev) and a guide to
[build your first Solana application](https://solana.com/developers/guides/getstarted/local-rust-hello-world).
